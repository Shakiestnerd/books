    <h2 class='account'>Site Information</h2>
    <p>This book site was created for my own personal use to keep track of which books I had read.  
    Back around the year 2000, I realized that the amount of reading I was doing had plummeted from
    my teenage years when I read continuously, to almost nothing.  I decided that reading was a key activity
    that should be cultivated.  In order to accomplish my resolution, I began tracking books that I read in 
    a spreadsheet, then eventually put together a database driven web site hosted locally.</p>
    <p>Feel free to create a log in and use the site if it pleases you.  There are no ads of any kind.
    Any information used will not be used for any purpose</p>
    <h2 class='account'>Usage</h2>
    <p>There are several buttons or tabs for managing your information.

        <li>Wish List - List of books I would like to read someday.</li>
